### Inserting & Finding parts

From here, using the library is pretty simple, as you can search for the item you want or scroll through the different menus like "wheels," "bearings," etc.

#### Insert part into assembly
1. Click on the part
2. You should see the part inserted into a random location somewhere in the assembly

Voila!
