A blog website (located at [https://maristfrc6340.github.io](https://maristfrc6340.github.io)) dedicated for creating instructional guides on FRC for 6340 members
<br>*Created by Alessio Toniolo*

## About
This is a blog generated from an existing HTML/CSS/JS blog template from Github. Team members with access to the Github organization can easily
make changes to the blog right from github.com. The blog is designed to facilitate the flow of knowledge from veteran members to newer members and even to keep
the team updated in more complex and advanced areas of FRC. As long as members are regularly add posts, this blog can really provide an effective method of teaching others how to work on special projects without
needing to have everyone gathered at once (a relatively hard feat).

## Instructions
1. To make a new blog post/resource, in the root of the project, press on the `_posts` folder
